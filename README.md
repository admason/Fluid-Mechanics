# Fluid-Mechanics
Mathematical modelling of fluid mechanics problems.
The implementation of a finite-difference projection methhod for the 2D incompressible Navier -Stokes equations to simulate a lid driven cavity. 
The vector plot describes the movement of the water within a 1m x 1m tank as the lid slides across the surface from left to right.
The turbulence caused is modelled by the vector plot.
Main files FLUIDQ3_RE100 has a Reynolds number set to 100 and FLUIDQÂ£_RE_1000 has a Reynolds number set to 1000. 
Note the PoissonSolver.m must be kept in the same file as the main files named FLUIDQ3_RE100 and FLUIDQ3_RE_1000
